ASSEMBLING THE SIGBOVIK PROCEEDINGS

0. Here is the order everything goes in (and the latex file to use as starter
code)

Front matter
- Title page (titlepage.tex)
- Copyright page (copyright-page.tex)
- Message from committee (message-from-committee.tex)
- Table of contents (table-of-contents.tex)

Main matter
- For each track:
  - Track listing (tracks.tex)
  - Papers and revies

Note on software. You will need something that is capable of concatenating PDFs,
redacting the page numbers that submitted papers come with, inserting new page
numbers, embedding fonts, resizing pages to all be 8"x11", etc. The recommended
software for this is Adobe Acrobat Pro (and Adobe Distiller), both of which are
available on the Mac cluster machines in Wean Hall.

1. Make the filler content.

Decide how to order the submissions in tracks, name the tracks, etc. Write the
message from the organizing committee. Update the year on the copyright page.
Make the track listings -- take author names as written on the papers
themselves, take keywords as submitted in "author keywords" on easychair.
Etcetera.

2. Assemble the main matter.

- Download submissions.zip from easychair.
- Use acrobat -> create new -> combine multiple files into one PDF
- Drag & drop your tracks.pdf track listings, papers, and reviews.
- I like to drag+drop the entirety of tracks.pdf multiple times, and go through
  after combining and delete N*(N-1) pages of track listings, rather than
  having latex compile a separate PDF for each track, because it makes making
  the table of contents easier.
- Insert blank pages (shift-command-T) into the PDF so each paper and each track
  listing starts on an odd-numbered page.
- Open the "tools" pane on the right, and find the "redaction" option. "Mark for
  redaction" all the spurious page numbers. Go to redaction preferences and make
  sure the redaction fill color is set to white, not black. Apply redactions.
- Still in the tools pane, find "header and footer". Insert actual page numbers.
  Choose an obnoxious font if possible.
- Save as PDF if you like, but print to postscript.
- Feed the postscript into Adobe Distiller. This makes all the pages the same
  size.

3. Assemble the front matter.

- Insert blank pages so the front matter has an even number of pages (so the
  main matter is aligned correctly).
- Write down all the page numbers from the main matter in your table of
  contents.
- Insert page numbers in the "i, ii, iii, iv" style. Skip "i" on the title page.
  I don't know how to make Acrobat do this style on its own, so I just manually
  type out the roman numerals for each page (using the "page range" button in
  the header+footer dialog box). It's not so bad; there are only 6-8 pages.

4. Assemble proceedings.pdf.

- Once more do create new -> combine multiple files into one PDF. Combine main
  matter and front matter.
- Double check the page numbers in your table of contents. Double check that
  papers and tracks start on odd-numbered pages.
- Embed all fonts -- go to Edit -> Preflight -> PDF Fixups -> Embed fonts. This
  will save it as a new PDF file.
- Open that PDF file and export as postscript (I almost typed javascript, oh
  god) and Distill again into a PDF.
- Upload that final PDF to the website and turn it into a book on Lulu.
- The Lulu account is the conference gmail address and the password is the same
  as the gmail account password. Order 30 copies.
- Save your Lulu order receipt to get reimbursed from the conference funds.
