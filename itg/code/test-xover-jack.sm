8,1,0,2,0,0
# note: before adding those first 2 steps (RD), the alg would step the chart
# differently depending what foot you started it on, returning 6,1,0,2,0,0 if
# starting on the left foot (stream flips = false,true,false), vs 6,1,1,1,0,1
# if starting on the right foot (stream flips = true,true,false); instead doing
# a xover-switch on "gets flipped" and a jack on the 2nd "j" only
# so i added those first two lines to break the tie, starting the chart on a
# not-crossed-over step no matter what
